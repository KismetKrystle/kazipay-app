## 🔐 Smart Contract Credit Scoring System

KaziPay features an innovative trust scoring mechanism that evaluates XRP wallet reliability based on transaction history and account activity. This creates transparency and builds confidence between clients and freelancers.

### 📊 Scoring Algorithm (Maximum: 850 points)

| **Factor** | **Description** | **Max Points** | **Formula** |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Base Score** | Starting score for all users | 300 | Fixed baseline |
| **Success Rate** | Transaction completion ratio | 100 | `(successfulTxs / totalTxs) × 100` |
| **Payment Activity** | Volume of payment transactions | 100 | `min(paymentTxs × 10, 100)` |
| **Account Age** | Wallet maturity indicator | 100 | `min(daysOld × 2, 100)` |
| **Transaction Volume** | Total XRP moved | 100 | `min(totalVolume / 1,000,000, 100)` |
| **Average Transaction** | Mean transaction size | 100 | `min(avgTxSize / 10,000, 100)` |
| **Verification Bonus** | DID-verified accounts | 50 | Binary bonus |
| **NFT Reward** | Unlocked at 750+ score | - | Exclusive NFT mint |

### 🔍 Data Sources & Implementation

- **Transaction Analysis**: Last 100 XRP Ledger transactions
- **Account Metrics**: Wallet creation date and activity patterns  
- **Success Tracking**: Completed vs failed transaction ratio
- **Identity Verification**: Decentralized Identity (DID) integration
- **Failsafe Protection**: Defaults to 300 points if calculation fails

The credit score is displayed via the `CreditScoreDisplay` component in the navigation bar when a wallet is connected and verified.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 📱 Core Components

### Frontend Architecture

### Smart Contract Logic

The `escrow_service.js` smart contract manages the complete project lifecycle:

1. **Creates Project** - Establishes escrow and holds project payment in XRP until specific conditions are met
2. **Finishes Transaction** - Releases the escrowed XRP to the recipient once conditions are satisfied  
3. **Cancels Transaction** - Cancels the escrow if conditions aren't met within a specified timeframe

Additional contract features:
- **NFT Rewards**: Automatically mints exclusive NFTs for users achieving 750+ credit scores
- **Multi-token Support**: Handles various XRP Ledger tokens beyond native XRP

## 🌍 Use Cases
